        <p>
          My full name is <strong>Pavan Sundar Reddy Guthikonda</strong>. I know it's a big name 😅 — you can just call me <strong>Pavan</strong>.

          Welcome to my digital corner! I’m a passionate tech enthusiast and a firm believer that every byte of data tells a story — you just need the right lens to see it. I'm currently pursuing my <strong>MS in Data Science & Analytics</strong> at the University of Missouri – Kansas City, where I'm building a future rooted in curiosity, logic, and a bit of caffeine. ☕️📊
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic pursuits are fueled by a desire to understand the world through numbers, patterns, and intelligent algorithms. I'm not just learning data science — I'm living it, one dataset at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Impelsys and Cognizant, I’ve had the chance to dive deep into real-world software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and data analytics. From UFT test automation to architecting scalable ETL pipelines and integrating cloud services with Python — I’ve worn many hats (and coded in many IDEs).
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm driven by curiosity and powered by code. Whether it's building a recommendation engine, experimenting with generative AI, or analyzing health trends using machine learning — I chase innovation with energy and intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the tech world, I enjoy playing badminton, lifting at the gym, watching multilingual cinema, and mentoring peers. I believe in continuous growth, shared knowledge, and the power of technology to bring meaningful change.
