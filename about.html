        <p>
          My full name is <strong>Pavan Sundar Reddy Guthikonda</strong>. I know it's a big name 😅 — you can just call me <strong>Pavan</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my digital corner! I’m a passionate tech enthusiast and a firm believer that every byte of data tells a story — you just need the right lens to see it. I'm currently pursuing my <strong>MS in Data Science & Analytics</strong> at the University of Missouri – Kansas City, where I'm building a future rooted in curiosity, logic, and a bit of caffeine. ☕️📊
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic pursuits are fueled by a desire to understand the world through numbers, patterns, and intelligent algorithms. I'm not just learning data science — I'm living it, one dataset at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>Impelsys</strong>, I worked as a Software Engineer and contributed to the development and optimization of Laerdal’s healthcare applications. I spearheaded ETL pipeline development and led initiatives to refactor 30% of the legacy codebase, significantly enhancing code maintainability. I also managed SQL optimization for backend systems and integrated AWS services like EC2 for scalable deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to that, I interned at <strong>Cognizant</strong> where I focused on automating test scripts using UFT, streamlining testing workflows, and conducting rigorous data-driven testing across core modules. This experience honed my analytical thinking and prepared me for cross-functional collaboration in fast-paced tech environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm driven by curiosity and powered by code. Whether it's building a recommendation engine, experimenting with generative AI, or analyzing health trends using machine learning — I chase innovation with energy and intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the tech world, I enjoy playing badminton, lifting at the gym, watching multilingual cinema, and mentoring peers. I believe in continuous growth, shared knowledge, and the power of technology to bring meaningful change.
